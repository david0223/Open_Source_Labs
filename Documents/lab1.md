c3. Overall, the chapter has a well-meaning message. However, the author was clearly being biased and condescending in a 
way that frames the matter to his liking. In my opinion, if one is confident in their point of view, they should present
the matter in a neutral light and let it speak for itself. That being said, the author makes good points about the need to 
adjust the way we view intelectual property. In the age of the internet, thoughts can travel farther and faster than ever
before. The previous concept of creative propery is rapidly becoming impractical and archaic. The author does not, 
however, address the other side of the matter. That is to say, if creative property cannot be enforced, what happens
to those who depend on it? This is far more than a railroad company, creative property is something that artists and
non-artists in every corner of the country rely on to profit from their work. If one system is done away with, another
must replace it.
