2. Choosing a license is important because proper licensing is the core of open source software. No license means assumed
all rights reserved. Choosing the correct license is important as well, and it depends on how you want people to share
your software.

3. If there is no explicit license, the law assumes all rights reserved. This means that if you embed the code into
your project, you run the risk of the owner taking legal action against you.

4. While these events were before my time, I can agree with the points made by the author here. A platform that fails
to foster clear communication with it's users and restricts them from expanding the platform will lose to a platform
that makes use of the powerful base of users. It seems clear that the developers of gopher had a need to dictate the 
project, deciding the standards themselves rather than being open to the standards of the people who would be using it.

5. The Microsoft .NET core has just about the most permissive license around, the MIT license, and it makes sense to have
chosen it. .NET is hugely integrated, meaning that not only would a more restricive license lead to resentment, but 
more importantly the users have an incentive to keep it running well. Because so many people rely on it, the .NET core
is contributed to and improved voluntarily. This fosters an effective community of contributors that add to the code
because they want to, not because they are forced to.

7. For a developer, the GPL copyleft license would be best because it forces users that make derivative works to contribute
back to your source code. As a developer concerned with making their code the best that it can be, this is the best option.
For companies, it depends on the nature of the project. If the company want their code to be embedded in many derivative
works, the permissive MIT license would be best. If fostering a community that contributes back to the project would be
of greater interest, the GPL license might be best. Finally, for the greater good and overall benefit of the public, the 
MIT license is the best. It gives users the most freedom to use the code in their own work without having to make their
additions that they worked hard on availiable. 

9. In the world of video games, there is a certain way of playing a game called "speedrunning". The idea is to complete a game
from start to finish as quickly as possible, and compare your time to other speedrunners. In order to identify where they need
the most improvement, there exists primitive software to compare each attempt with other catalogued attempts and show 
which parts of the game were done faster or slower. I would like to make a better version of this software. 
  The license I would choose in this case would be the GPL copyleft license. This community is relatively small, so fostering
a tight-knit group of contributers is in my best interest. Many speedrunners having experience coding, so the may want to 
improve this service for their own personal use. It is then best for the community as a whole if they give those changes back
so that everyone can use them.
